Limit your usage of 3rd party libraries only to the few ones that add a large benefit to the architecture and testability(which will carry extra weightage) of the project. Good example of libraries that could be used are RxJava etc.Candidate can create a GitHub repository in order to commit & push the code. After completion should share the GitHub repository.
